Thanks for visiting. 

I am an undergraduate student at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University , passionate towards Machine learning and Data Science. I am life long learner and my current motive is to learn new things and apply those learnings towards research . I love watching cricket, make new friends, play chess and YouTube is 30% of my day . I believe that everyone has the power to be whatever they want in this life if they put there mind to it, you decide and define your own destiny, your own legend.
